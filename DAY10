Help Ishaan
Ishaan has been given a task by his teacher. He needs to find the Nth term of a series. His teacher gives him some examples to help him out (Refer examples below). He is a bit weak in pattern searching so to help him his teacher told him that the Nth term is related to prime numbers. The Nth term is the difference of N and the closest prime number to N. Help him find the Nth term for a given N.
 

Example 1:

Input: N = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: Closest prime to 10 is 11.
Example 2:

Input: N = 7
Output: 0
Explanation: Closest prime to 7 is 7.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function NthTerm() which takes N as input paramater and returns Nth term.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N* âˆš N)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 100000

{
    public int NthTerm(int N)
    {
        // code here
        if(isPrime(N)) return 0;
        int i = N-1, j = N+1;
        while(true){
            if(isPrime(i)){
                return N-i;
            }
            
            if(isPrime(j)){
                return j-N;
            }
            i--;
            j++;
        }
    }
    
    private boolean isPrime(int n){
        if(n==0 || n==1)
        return false;
        for(int i = 2; i*i<=n; i++){
            if(n%i==0) 
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
